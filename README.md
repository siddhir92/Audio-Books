<h2> Conclusion 🤗 </h2>
“Audio Books” is a humble venture by us to create an application with all the knowledge
that had been imparted to us this semester. This application provides the features of
having digital books on our phones and making them easy to carry and listen whenever we want which has been our primary objective.
This project has tested us in our knowledge of the basics of Application Development and
therefore, has been a welcoming challenge to face as it did help us in polishing our skills
in Application Development.

<h2>Future Enhancement😎 </h2>
In a nutshell, it can be summarized that the future scope of the project circles around
maintaining information regarding:
● The Settings button is under development and we hope to provide a feature which
provides users the ability to send us the developers, feedback
● More advance features can be implemented by us on the application
● We would also like to provide the user the choice of changing the theme from
Light To Dark so as to help save battery.
● Integrate Machine Learning so that it can take in various inputs and automatically
Suggest books.
● Provide the users with how much percent of the book they have finished or set reminders at a particular time they want to read the book.
